Tools exist to generate rudimentary JavaDoc for Java programs, but the result isn’t particularly helpful as it just gives parameter names and return types from the signature and no useful information.  The goal of this project is to provide a more reasonable initial documentation source using LLMs and other tools.  There have been a number of research efforts along this line that could be a good starting point.\\n\\n## Initial Implementation Goals\\n\\n### Description\\nA web app that, when provided a github link, generates a confluence page describing what the app does based on classes/methods within. This process will work on most mainstream languages, but will be implemented focusing on a Java source code target. The confluence pages shall follow the same file structure as the source code and shall have a one to one mapping. Each page shall describe the source code at the functional level, ensuring that the source code is covered to an acceptable level. \\n\\n\\n### LLM Implementation\\nWe will be implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend. RAG is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating a step to fetch new data based on user inputs, thus improving response accuracy. This process involves collecting new information from diverse sources (a code base in our use case) and converting it into a format the LLM can search. It then matches user queries with this external data using vector representations for precise retrieval. Finally, the process enriches user prompts with the retrieved data, enabling the LLM to generate responses that are not only accurate but also contextually relevant, leveraging both its pre-existing knowledge and newly acquired information.\\n\\n### Documentation Regeneration\\nAs far as updating goes, we will integrate Github Actions with our implementation such that a push to main in a hypothetical target repository would trigger a regeneration of the confluence page. This will ensure that the documentation remains up to date\\n\\n\\n# Run instructions\\n\\n## Files to create\\n1. Download token_server.json and token_client.json from Slack\\n2.

Type annotations are strongly encouraged; if there is even a slight chance that the type will be ambiguous to future readers, put in a type annotation.\\n\\nType annotations are based on the ES4/JS2 type system, and are documented in the Google JavaScript style guide.\\n\\n@param and @return type annotations that have comments that do not fit on one line wrap to the next line and indent 4 spaces.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```javascript\\n/**\\n * A UI component allows users to select badges from their full list\\n * of earned badges, displaying them in a container.\\n * Expects a Badges.BadgeList as a model.\\n */\\nBadges.DisplayCase = Backbone.View.extend({\\n    /**\\n     * Whether or not this is currently in edit mode and the full\\n     * badge list is visible.\\n     */\\n    editing: false,\\n\\n    /**\\n     * The full user badge list available to pick from when in edit mode.\\n     * @type {Badges.UserBadgeList}\\n     */\\n    fullBadgeList: null,\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Enters \"edit mode\" where badges can be added/removed.\\n     * @param {number=} index Optional index of the slot in the display-case\\n     *     to be edited. Defaults to the first available slot, or if none\\n     *     are available, the last used slot.\\n     * @return {Badges.DisplayCase} This same instance so calls can be\\n     *     chained.\\n     */\\n    edit: function(index) {\\n    …\\n    },\\n   ...\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Sources\\n\\nhttp://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/es6-in-depth\\nhttp://projects.formidablelabs.com/es6-interactive-guide/#/\\nhttps://github.com/Khan/style-guides/blob/master/style/javascript.md', metadata={'source': 'coding-standards/javascript-guidelines.md', 'file_path': 'coding-standards/javascript-guidelines.md', 'file_name': 'javascript-guidelines.md', 'file_type': '.md'}), Document(page_content='<!--\\nAUTHORS:\\nPrefer only GitHub-flavored Markdown in external text.\\nSee README.md for details.\\n-->\\n\\n# Python Style Guide\\n\\n## Adapted from the Google python standards\\n\\n<!-- markdown=\"1\" is required for GitHub Pages to render the TOC properly. -->\\n\\n<details markdown=\"1\">\\n  <summary>Table of Contents</summary>\\n\\n- [Python Style Guide](#python-style-guide)\\n  -

This style guide is a list\\nof *dos and don\\'ts* for Python programs.\\n\\nTo help you format code correctly, we\\'ve created a [settings file for Vim](google_python_style.vim). For Emacs, the default settings should be fine.\\n\\nMany teams use the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) or [Pyink](https://github.com/google/pyink)\\nauto-formatter to avoid arguing over formatting.\\n\\n\\n<a id=\"s2-python-language-rules\"></a>\\n<a id=\"2-python-language-rules\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"python-language-rules\"></a>\\n## 2 Python Language Rules \\n\\n<a id=\"s2.1-lint\"></a>\\n<a id=\"21-lint\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"lint\"></a>\\n### 2.1 Lint \\n\\nRun `pylint` over your code using this [pylintrc](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pylintrc).\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.1.1-definition\"></a>\\n<a id=\"211-definition\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"lint-definition\"></a>\\n#### 2.1.1 Definition \\n\\n`pylint`\\nis a tool for finding bugs and style problems in Python source code. It finds\\nproblems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages like\\nC and C++. Because of the dynamic nature of Python, some\\nwarnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly\\ninfrequent.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.1.2-pros\"></a>\\n<a id=\"212-pros\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"lint-pros\"></a>\\n#### 2.1.2 Pros \\n\\nCatches easy-to-miss errors like typos, using-vars-before-assignment, etc.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.1.3-cons\"></a>\\n<a id=\"213-cons\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"lint-cons\"></a>\\n#### 2.1.3 Cons \\n\\n`pylint`\\nisn\\'t perfect. To take advantage of it, sometimes we\\'ll need to write around it,\\nsuppress its warnings or fix it.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.1.4-decision\"></a>\\n<a id=\"214-decision\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"lint-decision\"></a>\\n#### 2.1.4 Decision \\n\\nMake sure you run\\n`pylint`\\non your code.\\n\\n\\nSuppress warnings if they are inappropriate so that other issues are not hidden.\\nTo suppress warnings, you can set a line-level comment:\\n\\n```python\\ndef do_PUT(self):  # WSGI name, so pylint: disable=invalid-name\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n`pylint`\\nwarnings are each identified by symbolic name (`empty-docstring`)\\nGoogle-specific warnings start with `g-`.\\n\\nIf the reason for the suppression is not clear from the symbolic name, add an\\nexplanation.\\n\\nSuppressing in this way has the advantage that we can easily search for\\nsuppressions and revisit them.\\n\\nYou can get a list of\\n`pylint`\\nwarnings by doing:\\n\\n```shell\\npylint --list-msgs\\n```\\n\\nTo get more information on a particular message, use:\\n\\n```shell\\npylint --help-msg=invalid-name\\n```\\n\\nPrefer `pylint: disable` to the deprecated older form `pylint: disable-msg`.\\n\\nUnused argument warnings can be suppressed by deleting the variables at the\\nbeginning of the function. Always include a comment explaining why you are\\ndeleting it. \"Unused.\" is sufficient. For example:\\n\\n```python\\ndef viking_cafe_order(spam: str, beans: str, eggs: str | None = None) -> str:\\n    del beans, eggs  # Unused by vikings.\\n    return spam + spam + spam\\n```\\n\\nOther common forms of suppressing this warning include using \\'`_`\\' as the\\nidentifier for the unused argument or prefixing the argument name with\\n\\'`unused_`\\', or assigning them to \\'`_`\\'. These forms are allowed but no longer\\nencouraged. These break callers that pass arguments by name and do not enforce\\nthat the arguments are actually unused.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.2-imports\"></a>\\n<a id=\"22-imports\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"imports\"></a>\\n### 2.2 Imports \\n\\nUse `import` statements for packages and modules only, not for individual types,\\nclasses, or functions.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.2.1-definition\"></a>\\n<a id=\"221-definition\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"imports-definition\"></a>\\n#### 2.2.1 Definition \\n\\nReusability mechanism for sharing code from one module to another.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.2.2-pros\"></a>\\n<a id=\"222-pros\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"imports-pros\"></a>\\n#### 2.2.2 Pros \\n\\nThe namespace management convention is simple. The source of each identifier is\\nindicated in a consistent way; `x.Obj` says that object `Obj` is defined in\\nmodule `x`.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.2.3-cons\"></a>\\n<a id=\"223-cons\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"imports-cons\"></a>\\n#### 2.2.3 Cons \\n\\nModule names can still collide. Some module names are inconveniently long.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.2.4-decision\"></a>\\n<a id=\"224-decision\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"imports-decision\"></a>\\n#### 2.2.4 Decision \\n\\n*   Use `import x` for importing packages and modules.\\n*   Use `from x import y` where `x` is the package prefix and `y` is the module\\n    name with no prefix.\\n*   Use `from x import y as z` in any of the following circumstances:\\n    -   Two modules named `y` are to be imported.\\n    -   `y` conflicts with a top-level name defined in the current module.\\n    -   `y` conflicts with a common parameter name that is part of the public\\n        API (e.g., `features`).\\n    -   `y` is an inconveniently long name.\\n    -   `y` is too generic in the context of your code (e.g., `from\\n        storage.file_system import options as fs_options`).\\n*   Use `import y as z` only when `z` is a standard abbreviation (e.g., `import\\n    numpy as np`).\\n\\nFor example the module `sound.effects.echo` may be imported as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom sound.effects import echo\\n...\\necho.EchoFilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\n```\\n\\nDo not use relative names in imports. Even if the module is in the same package,\\nuse the full package name. This helps prevent unintentionally importing a\\npackage twice.\\n\\n<a id=\"imports-exemptions\"></a>\\n##### 2.2.4.1 Exemptions \\n\\nExemptions from this rule:\\n\\n*   Symbols from the following modules are used to support static analysis and\\n    type checking:\\n    *   [`typing` module](#typing-imports)\\n    *   [`collections.abc` module](#typing-imports)\\n    *   [`typing_extensions` module](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/README.md)\\n*   Redirects from the\\n    [six.moves module](https://six.readthedocs.io/#module-six.moves).\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.3-packages\"></a>\\n<a id=\"23-packages\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"packages\"></a>\\n### 2.3 Packages \\n\\nImport each module using the full pathname location of the module.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.3.1-pros\"></a>\\n<a id=\"231-pros\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"packages-pros\"></a>\\n#### 2.3.1 Pros \\n\\nAvoids conflicts in module names or incorrect imports due to the module search\\npath not being what the author expected. Makes it easier to find modules.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.3.2-cons\"></a>\\n<a id=\"232-cons\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"packages-cons\"></a>\\n#### 2.3.2 Cons \\n\\nMakes it harder to deploy code because you have to replicate the package\\nhierarchy. Not really a problem with modern deployment mechanisms.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.3.3-decision\"></a>\\n<a id=\"233-decision\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"packages-decision\"></a>\\n#### 2.3.3 Decision \\n\\nAll new code should import each module by its full package name.\\n\\nImports should be as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n  # Reference absl.flags in code with the complete name (verbose).\\n  import absl.flags\\n  from doctor.who import jodie\\n\\n  _FOO = absl.flags.DEFINE_string(...)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n  # Reference flags in code with just the module name (common).\\n  from absl import flags\\n  from doctor.who import jodie\\n\\n  _FOO = flags.DEFINE_string(...)\\n```\\n\\n*(assume this file lives in `doctor/who/` where `jodie.py` also exists)*\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\n  # Unclear what module the author wanted and what will be imported.  The actual\\n  # import behavior depends on external factors controlling sys.path.\\n  # Which possible jodie module did the author intend to import?\\n  import jodie\\n```\\n\\nThe directory the main binary is located in should not be assumed to be in\\n`sys.path` despite that happening in some environments. This being the case,\\ncode should assume that `import jodie` refers to a third-party or top-level\\npackage named `jodie`, not a local `jodie.py`.\\n\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.4-exceptions\"></a>\\n<a id=\"24-exceptions\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"exceptions\"></a>\\n### 2.4 Exceptions \\n\\nExceptions are allowed but must be used carefully.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.4.1-definition\"></a>\\n<a id=\"241-definition\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"exceptions-definition\"></a>\\n#### 2.4.1 Definition \\n\\nExceptions are a means of breaking out of normal control flow to handle errors\\nor other exceptional conditions.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.4.2-pros\"></a>\\n<a id=\"242-pros\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"exceptions-pros\"></a>\\n#### 2.4.2 Pros \\n\\nThe control flow of normal operation code is not cluttered by error-handling\\ncode. It also allows the control flow to skip multiple frames when a certain\\ncondition occurs, e.g., returning from N nested functions in one step instead of\\nhaving to plumb error codes through.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.4.3-cons\"></a>\\n<a id=\"243-cons\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"exceptions-cons\"></a>\\n#### 2.4.3 Cons \\n\\nMay cause the control flow to be confusing. Easy to miss error cases when making\\nlibrary calls.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.4.4-decision\"></a>\\n<a id=\"244-decision\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"exceptions-decision\"></a>\\n#### 2.4.4 Decision \\n\\nExceptions must follow certain conditions:\\n\\n-   Make use of built-in exception classes when it makes sense. For example,\\n    raise a `ValueError` to indicate a programming mistake like a violated\\n    precondition, such as may happen when validating function arguments.\\n\\n-   Do not use `assert` statements in place of conditionals or validating\\n    preconditions. They must not be critical to the application logic.

When doing so they\\n    must inherit from an existing exception class. Exception names should end in\\n    `Error` and should not introduce repetition (`foo.FooError`).\\n\\n-   Never use catch-all `except:` statements, or catch `Exception` or\\n    `StandardError`, unless you are\\n\\n    -   re-raising the exception, or\\n    -   creating an isolation point in the program where exceptions are not\\n        propagated but are recorded and suppressed instead, such as protecting a\\n        thread from crashing by guarding its outermost block.\\n\\n    Python is very tolerant in this regard and `except:` will really catch\\n    everything including misspelled names, sys.exit() calls, Ctrl+C interrupts,\\n    unittest failures and all kinds of other exceptions that you simply don\\'t\\n    want to catch.\\n\\n-   Minimize the amount of code in a `try`/`except` block. The larger the body\\n    of the `try`, the more likely that an exception will be raised by a line of\\n    code that you didn\\'t expect to raise an exception. In those cases, the\\n    `try`/`except` block hides a real error.\\n\\n-   Use the `finally` clause to execute code whether or not an exception is\\n    raised in the `try` block. This is often useful for cleanup, i.e., closing a\\n    file.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.5-global-variables\"></a>\\n<a id=\"25-global-variables\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s2.5-global-state\"></a>\\n<a id=\"25-global-state\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"global-variables\"></a>\\n### 2.5 Mutable Global State \\n\\nAvoid mutable global state.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.5.1-definition\"></a>\\n<a id=\"251-definition\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"global-variables-definition\"></a>\\n#### 2.5.1 Definition \\n\\nModule-level values or class attributes that can get mutated during program\\nexecution.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.5.2-pros\"></a>\\n<a id=\"252-pros\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"global-variables-pros\"></a>\\n#### 2.5.2 Pros \\n\\nOccasionally useful.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.5.3-cons\"></a>\\n<a id=\"253-cons\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"global-variables-cons\"></a>\\n#### 2.5.3 Cons \\n\\n*   Breaks encapsulation: Such design can make it hard to achieve valid\\n    objectives.

If you need to distinguish `False` from `None` then chain the\\n    expressions, such as `if not x and x is not None:`.\\n\\n-   For sequences (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences\\n    are false, so `if seq:` and `if not seq:` are preferable to `if len(seq):`\\n    and `if not len(seq):` respectively.\\n\\n-   When handling integers, implicit false may involve more risk than benefit\\n    (i.e., accidentally handling `None` as 0). You may compare a value which is\\n    known to be an integer (and is not the result of `len()`) against the\\n    integer 0.\\n\\n    ```python\\n    Yes: if not users:\\n             print(\\'no users\\')\\n\\n         if i % 10 == 0:\\n             self.handle_multiple_of_ten()\\n\\n         def f(x=None):\\n             if x is None:\\n                 x = []\\n    ```\\n\\n    ```python\\n    No:  if len(users) == 0:\\n             print(\\'no users\\')\\n\\n         if not i % 10:\\n             self.handle_multiple_of_ten()\\n\\n         def f(x=None):\\n             x = x or []\\n    ```\\n\\n-   Note that `\\'0\\'` (i.e., `0` as string) evaluates to true.\\n\\n-   Note that Numpy arrays may raise an exception in an implicit boolean\\n    context. Prefer the `.size` attribute when testing emptiness of a `np.array`\\n    (e.g. `if not users.size`).\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.16-lexical-scoping\"></a>\\n<a id=\"216-lexical-scoping\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"lexical-scoping\"></a>\\n### 2.16 Lexical Scoping \\n\\nOkay to use.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.16.1-definition\"></a>\\n<a id=\"2161-definition\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"lexical-scoping-definition\"></a>\\n#### 2.16.1 Definition \\n\\nA nested Python function can refer to variables defined in enclosing functions,\\nbut cannot assign to them. Variable bindings are resolved using lexical scoping,\\nthat is, based on the static program text. Any assignment to a name in a block\\nwill cause Python to treat all references to that name as a local variable, even\\nif the use precedes the assignment. If a global declaration occurs, the name is\\ntreated as a global variable.\\n\\nAn example of the use of this feature is:\\n\\n```python\\ndef get_adder(summand1: float) -> Callable[[float], float]:\\n    \"\"\"Returns a function that adds numbers to a given number.\"\"\"\\n    def adder(summand2: float) -> float:\\n        return summand1 + summand2\\n\\n    return adder\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.16.2-pros\"></a>\\n<a id=\"2162-pros\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"lexical-scoping-pros\"></a>\\n#### 2.16.2 Pros \\n\\nOften results in clearer, more elegant code.

One common decorator is `@property`, used for\\nconverting ordinary methods into dynamically computed attributes. However, the\\ndecorator syntax allows for user-defined decorators as well. Specifically, for\\nsome function `my_decorator`, this:\\n\\n```python\\nclass C:\\n    @my_decorator\\n    def method(self):\\n        # method body ...\\n```\\n\\nis equivalent to:\\n\\n```python\\nclass C:\\n    def method(self):\\n        # method body ...\\n    method = my_decorator(method)\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.17.2-pros\"></a>\\n<a id=\"2172-pros\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"decorators-pros\"></a>\\n#### 2.17.2 Pros \\n\\nElegantly specifies some transformation on a method; the transformation might\\neliminate some repetitive code, enforce invariants, etc.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.17.3-cons\"></a>\\n<a id=\"2173-cons\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"decorators-cons\"></a>\\n#### 2.17.3 Cons \\n\\nDecorators can perform arbitrary operations on a function\\'s arguments or return\\nvalues, resulting in surprising implicit behavior.

Decorators should\\nfollow the same import and naming guidelines as functions. Decorator pydoc\\nshould clearly state that the function is a decorator. Write unit tests for\\ndecorators.\\n\\nAvoid external dependencies in the decorator itself (e.g. don\\'t rely on files,\\nsockets, database connections, etc.), since they might not be available when the\\ndecorator runs (at import time, perhaps from `pydoc` or other tools). A\\ndecorator that is called with valid parameters should (as much as possible) be\\nguaranteed to succeed in all cases.\\n\\nDecorators are a special case of \"top-level code\" - see [main](#s3.17-main) for\\nmore discussion.\\n\\nNever use `staticmethod` unless forced to in order to integrate with an API\\ndefined in an existing library. Write a module-level function instead.\\n\\nUse `classmethod` only when writing a named constructor, or a class-specific\\nroutine that modifies necessary global state such as a process-wide cache.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.18-threading\"></a>\\n<a id=\"218-threading\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"threading\"></a>\\n### 2.18 Threading \\n\\nDo not rely on the atomicity of built-in types.\\n\\nWhile Python\\'s built-in data types such as dictionaries appear to have atomic\\noperations, there are corner cases where they aren\\'t atomic (e.g. if `__hash__`\\nor `__eq__` are implemented as Python methods) and their atomicity should not be\\nrelied upon. Neither should you rely on atomic variable assignment (since this\\nin turn depends on dictionaries).\\n\\nUse the `queue` module\\'s `Queue` data type as the preferred way to communicate\\ndata between threads. Otherwise, use the `threading` module and its locking\\nprimitives. Prefer condition variables and `threading.Condition` instead of\\nusing lower-level locks.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.19-power-features\"></a>\\n<a id=\"219-power-features\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"power-features\"></a>\\n### 2.19 Power Features \\n\\nAvoid these features.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.19.1-definition\"></a>\\n<a id=\"2191-definition\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"power-features-definition\"></a>\\n#### 2.19.1 Definition \\n\\nPython is an extremely flexible language and gives you many fancy features such\\nas custom metaclasses, access to bytecode, on-the-fly compilation, dynamic\\ninheritance, object reparenting, import hacks, reflection (e.g. some uses of\\n`getattr()`), modification of system internals, `__del__` methods implementing\\ncustomized cleanup, etc.\\n\\n<a id=\"s2.19.2-pros\"></a>\\n<a id=\"2192-pros\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"power-features-pros\"></a>\\n#### 2.19.2 Pros \\n\\nThese are powerful language features.

A docstring is a string that is the\\nfirst statement in a package, module, class or function. These strings can be\\nextracted automatically through the `__doc__` member of the object and are used\\nby `pydoc`.\\n(Try running `pydoc` on your module to see how it looks.) Always use the\\nthree-double-quote `\"\"\"` format for docstrings (per\\n[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)). A docstring should be organized\\nas a summary line (one physical line not exceeding 80 characters) terminated by\\na period, question mark, or exclamation point. When writing more (encouraged),\\nthis must be followed by a blank line, followed by the rest of the docstring\\nstarting at the same cursor position as the first quote of the first line. There\\nare more formatting guidelines for docstrings below.\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.8.2-comments-in-modules\"></a>\\n<a id=\"382-modules\"></a>\\n<a id=\"comments-in-modules\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"module-docs\"></a>\\n#### 3.8.2 Modules \\n\\nEvery file should contain license boilerplate. Choose the appropriate boilerplate for the license used by the project (for example, Apache 2.0, BSD, LGPL, GPL).\\n\\nFiles should start with a docstring describing the contents and usage of the\\nmodule.\\n```python\\n\"\"\"A one-line summary of the module or program, terminated by a period.\\n\\nLeave one blank line.  The rest of this docstring should contain an\\noverall description of the module or program.  Optionally, it may also\\ncontain a brief description of exported classes and functions and/or usage\\nexamples.\\n\\nTypical usage example:\\n\\n  foo = ClassFoo()\\n  bar = foo.FunctionBar()\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.8.2.1-test-modules\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"test-docs\"></a>\\n##### 3.8.2.1 Test modules \\n\\nModule-level docstrings for test files are not required. They should be included\\nonly when there is additional information that can be provided.\\n\\nExamples include some specifics on how the test should be run, an explanation of\\nan unusual setup pattern, dependency on the external environment, and so on.\\n\\n```python\\n\"\"\"This blaze test uses golden files.\\n\\nYou can update those files by running\\n`blaze run //foo/bar:foo_test -- --update_golden_files` from the `google3`\\ndirectory.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\nDocstrings that do not provide any new information should not be used.\\n\\n```python\\n\"\"\"Tests for foo.bar.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.8.3-functions-and-methods\"></a>\\n<a id=\"383-functions-and-methods\"></a>\\n<a id=\"functions-and-methods\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"function-docs\"></a>\\n#### 3.8.3 Functions and Methods \\n\\nIn this section, \"function\" means a method, function, generator, or property.\\n\\nA docstring is mandatory for every function that has one or more of the\\nfollowing properties:\\n\\n-   being part of the public API\\n-   nontrivial size\\n-   non-obvious logic\\n\\nA docstring should give enough information to write a call to the function\\nwithout reading the function\\'s code. The docstring should describe the\\nfunction\\'s calling syntax and its semantics, but generally not its\\nimplementation details, unless those details are relevant to how the function is\\nto be used. For example, a function that mutates one of its arguments as a side\\neffect should note that in its docstring. Otherwise, subtle but important\\ndetails of a function\\'s implementation that are not relevant to the caller are\\nbetter expressed as comments alongside the code than within the function\\'s\\ndocstring.\\n\\nThe docstring may be descriptive-style (`\"\"\"Fetches rows from a Bigtable.\"\"\"`)\\nor imperative-style (`\"\"\"Fetch rows from a Bigtable.\"\"\"`), but the style should\\nbe consistent within a file. The docstring for a `@property` data descriptor\\nshould use the same style as the docstring for an attribute or a\\n<a href=\"#doc-function-args\">function argument</a> (`\"\"\"The Bigtable path.\"\"\"`,\\nrather than `\"\"\"Returns the Bigtable path.\"\"\"`).\\n\\nCertain aspects of a function should be documented in special sections, listed\\nbelow. Each section begins with a heading line, which ends with a colon. All\\nsections other than the heading should maintain a hanging indent of two or four\\nspaces (be consistent within a file). These sections can be omitted in cases\\nwhere the function\\'s name and signature are informative enough that it can be\\naptly described using a one-line docstring.\\n\\n<a id=\"doc-function-args\"></a>\\n[*Args:*](#doc-function-args)\\n:   List each parameter by name. A description should follow the name, and be\\n    separated by a colon followed by either a space or newline. If the\\n    description is too long to fit on a single 80-character line, use a hanging\\n    indent of 2 or 4 spaces more than the parameter name (be consistent with the\\n    rest of the docstrings in the file). The description should include required\\n    type(s) if the code does not contain a corresponding type annotation. If a\\n    function accepts `*foo` (variable length argument lists) and/or `**bar`\\n    (arbitrary keyword arguments), they should be listed as `*foo` and `**bar`.\\n\\n<a id=\"doc-function-returns\"></a>\\n[*Returns:* (or *Yields:* for generators)](#doc-function-returns)\\n:   Describe the semantics of the return value, including any type information\\n    that the type annotation does not provide. If the function only returns\\n    None, this section is not required. It may also be omitted if the docstring\\n    starts with \"Return\", \"Returns\", \"Yield\", or \"Yields\" (e.g. `\"\"\"Returns row\\n    from Bigtable as a tuple of strings.\"\"\"`) *and* the opening sentence is\\n    sufficient to describe the return value. Do not imitate older \\'NumPy style\\'\\n    ([example](https://numpy.org/doc/1.24/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.qr.html)),\\n    which frequently documented a tuple return value as if it were multiple\\n    return values with individual names (never mentioning the tuple). Instead,\\n    describe such a return value as: \"Returns: A tuple (mat_a, mat_b), where\\n    mat_a is ..., and ...\". The auxiliary names in the docstring need not\\n    necessarily correspond to any internal names used in the function body (as\\n    those are not part of the API). If the function uses `yield` (is a\\n    generator), the `Yields:` section should document the object returned by\\n    `next()`, instead of the generator object itself that the call evaluates to.\\n\\n<a id=\"doc-function-raises\"></a>\\n[*Raises:*](#doc-function-raises)\\n:   List all exceptions that are relevant to the interface followed by a\\n    description. Use a similar exception name + colon + space or newline and\\n    hanging indent style as described in *Args:*. You should not document\\n    exceptions that get raised if the API specified in the docstring is violated\\n    (because this would paradoxically make behavior under violation of the API\\n    part of the API).\\n\\n```python\\ndef fetch_smalltable_rows(\\n    table_handle: smalltable.Table,\\n    keys: Sequence[bytes | str],\\n    require_all_keys: bool = False,\\n) -> Mapping[bytes, tuple[str, ...]]:\\n    \"\"\"Fetches rows from a Smalltable.\\n\\n    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance\\n    represented by table_handle.

If you\\'re going\\nto have to explain it at the next [code review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review),\\nyou should comment it now. Complicated operations get a few lines of comments\\nbefore the operations commence. Non-obvious ones get comments at the end of the\\nline.\\n\\n```python\\n# We use a weighted dictionary search to find out where i is in\\n# the array.  We extrapolate position based on the largest num\\n# in the array and the array size and then do binary search to\\n# get the exact number.\\n\\nif i & (i-1) == 0:  # True if i is 0 or a power of 2.\\n```\\n\\nTo improve legibility, these comments should start at least 2 spaces away from\\nthe code with the comment character `#`, followed by at least one space before\\nthe text of the comment itself.\\n\\nOn the other hand, never describe the code.

In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than sentence\\nfragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of code, can\\nsometimes be less formal, but you should be consistent with your style.\\n\\nAlthough it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that you are\\nusing a comma when you should be using a semicolon, it is very important that\\nsource code maintain a high level of clarity and readability. Proper\\npunctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that goal.\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.10-strings\"></a>\\n<a id=\"310-strings\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"strings\"></a>\\n### 3.10 Strings \\n\\nUse an\\n[f-string](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings),\\nthe `%` operator, or the `format` method for formatting strings, even when the\\nparameters are all strings. Use your best judgment to decide between string\\nformatting options. A single join with `+` is okay but do not format with `+`.\\n\\n```python\\nYes: x = f\\'name: {name}; score: {n}\\'\\n     x = \\'%s, %s!\\' % (imperative, expletive)\\n     x = \\'{}, {}\\'.format(first, second)\\n     x = \\'name: %s; score: %d\\' % (name, n)\\n     x = \\'name: %(name)s; score: %(score)d\\' % {\\'name\\':name, \\'score\\':n}\\n     x = \\'name: {}; score: {}\\'.format(name, n)\\n     x = a + b\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo: x = first + \\', \\' + second\\n    x = \\'name: \\' + name + \\'; score: \\' + str(n)\\n```\\n\\nAvoid using the `+` and `+=` operators to accumulate a string within a loop. In\\nsome conditions, accumulating a string with addition can lead to quadratic\\nrather than linear running time. Although common accumulations of this sort may\\nbe optimized on CPython, that is an implementation detail. The conditions under\\nwhich an optimization applies are not easy to predict and may change. Instead,\\nadd each substring to a list and `\\'\\'.join` the list after the loop terminates,\\nor write each substring to an `io.StringIO` buffer.

Pick `\\'`\\nor `\"` and stick with it.

This rule naturally\\nextends to closeable resources that internally use sockets, such as database\\nconnections, and also other resources that need to be closed down in a similar\\nfashion. To name only a few examples, this also includes\\n[mmap](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html) mappings,\\n[h5py File objects](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/file.html), and\\n[matplotlib.pyplot figure windows](https://matplotlib.org/2.1.0/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.close.html).\\n\\nLeaving files, sockets or other such stateful objects open unnecessarily has\\nmany downsides:\\n\\n-   They may consume limited system resources, such as file descriptors. Code\\n    that deals with many such objects may exhaust those resources unnecessarily\\n    if they\\'re not returned to the system promptly after use.\\n-   Holding files open may prevent other actions such as moving or deleting\\n    them, or unmounting a filesystem.\\n-   Files and sockets that are shared throughout a program may inadvertently be\\n    read from or written to after logically being closed. If they are actually\\n    closed, attempts to read or write from them will raise exceptions, making\\n    the problem known sooner.\\n\\nFurthermore, while files and sockets (and some similarly behaving resources) are\\nautomatically closed when the object is destructed, coupling the lifetime of the\\nobject to the state of the resource is poor practice:\\n\\n-   There are no guarantees as to when the runtime will actually invoke the\\n    `__del__` method. Different Python implementations use different memory\\n    management techniques, such as delayed garbage collection, which may\\n    increase the object\\'s lifetime arbitrarily and indefinitely.\\n-   Unexpected references to the file, e.g. in globals or exception tracebacks,\\n    may keep it around longer than intended.\\n\\nRelying on finalizers to do automatic cleanup that has observable side effects\\nhas been rediscovered over and over again to lead to major problems, across many\\ndecades and multiple languages (see e.g.\\n[this article](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/MET12-J.+Do+not+use+finalizers)\\nfor Java).\\n\\nThe preferred way to manage files and similar resources is using the\\n[`with` statement](http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement):\\n\\n```python\\nwith open(\"hello.txt\") as hello_file:\\n    for line in hello_file:\\n        print(line)\\n```\\n\\nFor file-like objects that do not support the `with` statement, use\\n`contextlib.closing()`:\\n\\n```python\\nimport contextlib\\n\\nwith contextlib.closing(urllib.urlopen(\"http://www.python.org/\")) as front_page:\\n    for line in front_page:\\n        print(line)\\n```\\n\\nIn rare cases where context-based resource management is infeasible, code\\ndocumentation must explain clearly how resource lifetime is managed.\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.12-todo-comments\"></a>\\n<a id=\"312-todo-comments\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"todo\"></a>\\n### 3.12 TODO Comments \\n\\nUse `TODO` comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or\\ngood-enough but not perfect.\\n\\nA `TODO` comment begins with the word `TODO` in all caps, a following colon, and\\na link to a resource that contains the context, ideally a bug reference. A bug\\nreference is preferable because bugs are tracked and have follow-up comments.\\nFollow this piece of context with an explanatory string introduced with a hyphen\\n`-`. \\nThe purpose is to have a consistent `TODO` format that can be searched to find\\nout how to get more details. \\n\\n```python\\n# TODO: crbug.com/192795 - Investigate cpufreq optimizations.\\n```\\n\\nOld style, formerly recommended, but discouraged for use in new code:\\n\\n\\n```python\\n# TODO(crbug.com/192795): Investigate cpufreq optimizations.\\n# TODO(yourusername): Use a \"\\\\*\" here for concatenation operator.\\n```\\n\\nAvoid adding TODOs that refer to an individual or team as the context:\\n\\n```python\\n# TODO: @yourusername - File an issue and use a \\'*\\' for repetition.\\n```\\n\\nIf your `TODO` is of the form \"At a future date do something\" make sure that you\\neither include a very specific date (\"Fix by November 2009\") or a very specific\\nevent (\"Remove this code when all clients can handle XML responses.\") that\\nfuture code maintainers will comprehend.

By comparison,\\nif setting a variable means some state is invalidated or rebuilt, it should be a\\nsetter function. The function invocation hints that a potentially non-trivial\\noperation is occurring. Alternatively, [properties](#properties) may be an\\noption when simple logic is needed, or refactoring to no longer need getters and\\nsetters.\\n\\nGetters and setters should follow the [Naming](#s3.16-naming) guidelines, such\\nas `get_foo()` and `set_foo()`.\\n\\nIf the past behavior allowed access through a property, do not bind the new\\ngetter/setter functions to the property.

Generally speaking,\\n    descriptiveness should be proportional to the name\\'s scope of visibility.\\n    For example, `i` might be a fine name for 5-line code block but within\\n    multiple nested scopes, it is likely too vague.\\n\\n-   dashes (`-`) in any package/module name\\n\\n-   `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__` names (reserved by Python)\\n\\n-   offensive terms\\n\\n-   names that needlessly include the type of the variable (for example:\\n    `id_to_name_dict`)\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.16.2-naming-conventions\"></a>\\n<a id=\"3162-naming-convention\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"naming-conventions\"></a>\\n#### 3.16.2 Naming Conventions \\n\\n-   \"Internal\" means internal to a module, or protected or private within a\\n    class.\\n\\n-   Prepending a single underscore (`_`) has some support for protecting module\\n    variables and functions (linters will flag protected member access). Note\\n    that it is okay for unit tests to access protected constants from the\\n    modules under test.\\n\\n-   Prepending a double underscore (`__` aka \"dunder\") to an instance variable\\n    or method effectively makes the variable or method private to its class\\n    (using name mangling); we discourage its use as it impacts readability and\\n    testability, and isn\\'t *really* private. Prefer a single underscore.\\n\\n-   Place related classes and top-level functions together in a\\n    module.\\n    Unlike Java, there is no need to limit yourself to one class per module.\\n\\n-   Use CapWords for class names, but lower\\\\_with\\\\_under.py for module names.\\n    Although there are some old modules named CapWords.py, this is now\\n    discouraged because it\\'s confusing when the module happens to be named after\\n    a class. (\"wait -- did I write `import StringIO` or `from StringIO import\\n    StringIO`?\")\\n\\n-   New *unit test* files follow PEP 8 compliant lower\\\\_with\\\\_under method\\n    names, for example, `test_<method_under_test>_<state>`. For consistency(\\\\*)\\n    with legacy modules that follow CapWords function names, underscores may\\n    appear in method names starting with `test` to separate logical components\\n    of the name.

If a\\nfile is meant to be used as an executable, its main functionality should be in a\\n`main()` function, and your code should always check `if __name__ == \\'__main__\\'`\\nbefore executing your main program, so that it is not executed when the module\\nis imported.\\n\\nWhen using [absl](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py), use `app.run`:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom absl import app\\n...\\n\\ndef main(argv: Sequence[str]):\\n    # process non-flag arguments\\n    ...\\n\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    app.run(main)\\n```\\n\\nOtherwise, use:\\n\\n```python\\ndef main():\\n    ...\\n\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    main()\\n```\\n\\nAll code at the top level will be executed when the module is imported.

If a function exceeds about 40 lines, think about\\nwhether it can be broken up without harming the structure of the program.\\n\\nEven if your long function works perfectly now, someone modifying it in a few\\nmonths may add new behavior. This could result in bugs that are hard to find.\\nKeeping your functions short and simple makes it easier for other people to read\\nand modify your code.\\n\\nYou could find long and complicated functions when working with\\nsome\\ncode. Do not be intimidated by modifying existing code: if working with such a\\nfunction proves to be difficult, you find that errors are hard to debug, or you\\nwant to use a piece of it in several different contexts, consider breaking up\\nthe function into smaller and more manageable pieces.\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19-type-annotations\"></a>\\n<a id=\"319-type-annotations\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"type-annotations\"></a>\\n### 3.19 Type Annotations \\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.1-general-rules\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s3.19.1-general\"></a>\\n<a id=\"3191-general-rules\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"typing-general\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.1 General Rules \\n\\n*   Familiarize yourself with [PEP-484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/).\\n\\n*   Annotating `self` or `cls` is generally not necessary.\\n    [`Self`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Self) can be\\n    used if it is necessary for proper type information, e.g.\\n\\n    ```python\\n    from typing import Self\\n\\n    class BaseClass:\\n      @classmethod\\n      def create(cls) -> Self:\\n        ...\\n\\n      def difference(self, other: Self) -> float:\\n        ...\\n    ```\\n\\n*   Similarly, don\\'t feel compelled to annotate the return value of `__init__`\\n    (where `None` is the only valid option).\\n\\n*   If any other variable or a returned type should not be expressed, use `Any`.\\n\\n*   You are not required to annotate all the functions in a module.\\n\\n    -   At least annotate your public APIs.\\n    -   Use judgment to get to a good balance between safety and clarity on the\\n        one hand, and flexibility on the other.\\n    -   Annotate code that is prone to type-related errors (previous bugs or\\n        complexity).\\n    -   Annotate code that is hard to understand.\\n    -   Annotate code as it becomes stable from a types perspective. In many\\n        cases, you can annotate all the functions in mature code without losing\\n        too much flexibility.\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.2-line-breaking\"></a>\\n<a id=\"3192-line-breaking\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"typing-line-breaking\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.2 Line Breaking \\n\\nTry to follow the existing [indentation](#indentation) rules.\\n\\nAfter annotating, many function signatures will become \"one parameter per line\".\\nTo ensure the return type is also given its own line, a comma can be placed\\nafter the last parameter.\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_method(\\n    self,\\n    first_var: int,\\n    second_var: Foo,\\n    third_var: Bar | None,\\n) -> int:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nAlways prefer breaking between variables, and not, for example, between variable\\nnames and type annotations. However, if everything fits on the same line, go for\\nit.\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_method(self, first_var: int) -> int:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nIf the combination of the function name, the last parameter, and the return type\\nis too long, indent by 4 in a new line. When using line breaks, prefer putting\\neach parameter and the return type on their own lines and aligning the closing\\nparenthesis with the `def`:\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\ndef my_method(\\n    self,\\n    other_arg: MyLongType | None,\\n) -> tuple[MyLongType1, MyLongType1]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nOptionally, the return type may be put on the same line as the last parameter:\\n\\n```python\\nOkay:\\ndef my_method(\\n    self,\\n    first_var: int,\\n    second_var: int) -> dict[OtherLongType, MyLongType]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n`pylint`\\nallows you to move the closing parenthesis to a new line and align with the\\nopening one, but this is less readable.\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\ndef my_method(self,\\n              other_arg: MyLongType | None,\\n             ) -> dict[OtherLongType, MyLongType]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nAs in the examples above, prefer not to break types. However, sometimes they are\\ntoo long to be on a single line (try to keep sub-types unbroken).\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_method(\\n    self,\\n    first_var: tuple[list[MyLongType1],\\n                     list[MyLongType2]],\\n    second_var: list[dict[\\n        MyLongType3, MyLongType4]],\\n) -> None:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nIf a single name and type is too long, consider using an\\n[alias](#typing-aliases) for the type. The last resort is to break after the\\ncolon and indent by 4.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\ndef my_function(\\n    long_variable_name:\\n        long_module_name.LongTypeName,\\n) -> None:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\ndef my_function(\\n    long_variable_name: long_module_name.\\n        LongTypeName,\\n) -> None:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.3-forward-declarations\"></a>\\n<a id=\"3193-forward-declarations\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"forward-declarations\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.3 Forward Declarations \\n\\nIf you need to use a class name (from the same module) that is not yet\\ndefined -- for example, if you need the class name inside the declaration of\\nthat class, or if you use a class that is defined later in the code -- either\\nuse `from __future__ import annotations` or use a string for the class name.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\nfrom __future__ import annotations\\n\\nclass MyClass:\\n  def __init__(self, stack: Sequence[MyClass], item: OtherClass) -> None:\\n\\nclass OtherClass:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\nclass MyClass:\\n  def __init__(self, stack: Sequence[\\'MyClass\\'], item: \\'OtherClass\\') -> None:\\n\\nclass OtherClass:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.4-default-values\"></a>\\n<a id=\"3194-default-values\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"typing-default-values\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.4 Default Values \\n\\nAs per [PEP-008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations), use\\nspaces around the `=` *only* for arguments that have both a type annotation and\\na default value.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\ndef func(a: int = 0) -> int:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\ndef func(a:int=0) -> int:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.5-nonetype\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s3.19.5-none-type\"></a>\\n<a id=\"3195-nonetype\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"none-type\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.5 NoneType \\n\\nIn the Python type system, `NoneType` is a \"first class\" type, and for typing\\npurposes, `None` is an alias for `NoneType`. If an argument can be `None`, it\\nhas to be declared! You can use `|` union type expressions (recommended in new\\nPython 3.10+ code), or the older `Optional` and `Union` syntaxes.\\n\\nUse explicit `X | None` instead of implicit. Earlier versions of PEP 484 allowed\\n`a: str = None` to be interpreted as `a: str | None = None`, but that is no\\nlonger the preferred behavior.\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\ndef modern_or_union(a: str | int | None, b: str | None = None) -> str:\\n  ...\\ndef union_optional(a: Union[str, int, None], b: Optional[str] = None) -> str:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\ndef nullable_union(a: Union[None, str]) -> str:\\n  ...\\ndef implicit_optional(a: str = None) -> str:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.6-type-aliases\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s3.19.6-aliases\"></a>\\n<a id=\"3196-type-aliases\"></a>\\n<a id=\"typing-aliases\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"type-aliases\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.6 Type Aliases \\n\\nYou can declare aliases of complex types. The name of an alias should be\\nCapWorded.

Typed tuples can either\\nhave a single repeated type or a set number of elements with different types.\\nThe latter is commonly used as the return type from a function.\\n\\n```python\\na: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]\\nb: tuple[int, ...] = (1, 2, 3)\\nc: tuple[int, str, float] = (1, \"2\", 3.5)\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.10-typevars\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s3.19.10-type-var\"></a>\\n<a id=\"31910-typevar\"></a>\\n<a id=\"typing-type-var\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"typevars\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.10 Type variables \\n\\nThe Python type system has\\n[generics](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#generics). A type variable, such as\\n`TypeVar` and `ParamSpec`, is a common way to use them.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections.abc import Callable\\nfrom typing import ParamSpec, TypeVar\\n_P = ParamSpec(\"_P\")\\n_T = TypeVar(\"_T\")\\n...\\ndef next(l: list[_T]) -> _T:\\n  return l.pop()\\n\\ndef print_when_called(f: Callable[_P, _T]) -> Callable[_P, _T]:\\n  def inner(*args: _P.args, **kwargs: _P.kwargs) -> _T:\\n    print(\"Function was called\")\\n    return f(*args, **kwargs)\\n  return inner\\n```\\n\\nA `TypeVar` can be constrained:\\n\\n```python\\nAddableType = TypeVar(\"AddableType\", int, float, str)\\ndef add(a: AddableType, b: AddableType) -> AddableType:\\n  return a + b\\n```\\n\\nA common predefined type variable in the `typing` module is `AnyStr`. Use it for\\nmultiple annotations that can be `bytes` or `str` and must all be the same type.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import AnyStr\\ndef check_length(x: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:\\n  if len(x) <= 42:\\n    return x\\n  raise ValueError()\\n```\\n\\nA type variable must have a descriptive name, unless it meets all of the\\nfollowing criteria:\\n\\n*   not externally visible\\n*   not constrained\\n\\n```python\\nYes:\\n  _T = TypeVar(\"_T\")\\n  _P = ParamSpec(\"_P\")\\n  AddableType = TypeVar(\"AddableType\", int, float, str)\\n  AnyFunction = TypeVar(\"AnyFunction\", bound=Callable)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\nNo:\\n  T = TypeVar(\"T\")\\n  P = ParamSpec(\"P\")\\n  _T = TypeVar(\"_T\", int, float, str)\\n  _F = TypeVar(\"_F\", bound=Callable)\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.11-string-types\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s3.19.11-strings\"></a>\\n<a id=\"31911-string-types\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"typing-strings\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.11 String types \\n\\n> Do not use `typing.Text` in new code. It\\'s only for Python 2/3 compatibility.\\n\\nUse `str` for string/text data. For code that deals with binary data, use\\n`bytes`.\\n\\n```python\\ndef deals_with_text_data(x: str) -> str:\\n  ...\\ndef deals_with_binary_data(x: bytes) -> bytes:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nIf all the string types of a function are always the same, for example if the\\nreturn type is the same as the argument type in the code above, use\\n[AnyStr](#typing-type-var).\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.12-imports-for-typing\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s3.19.12-imports\"></a>\\n<a id=\"31912-imports-for-typing\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"typing-imports\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.12 Imports For Typing \\n\\nFor symbols (including types, functions, and constants) from the `typing` or\\n`collections.abc` modules used to support static analysis and type checking,\\nalways import the symbol itself. This keeps common annotations more concise and\\nmatches typing practices used around the world. You are explicitly allowed to\\nimport multiple specific symbols on one line from the `typing` and\\n`collections.abc` modules. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections.abc import Mapping, Sequence\\nfrom typing import Any, Generic, cast, TYPE_CHECKING\\n```\\n\\nGiven that this way of importing adds items to the local namespace, names in\\n`typing` or `collections.abc` should be treated similarly to keywords, and not\\nbe defined in your Python code, typed or not. If there is a collision between a\\ntype and an existing name in a module, import it using `import x as y`.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Any as AnyType\\n```\\n\\nPrefer to use built-in types as annotations where available. Python supports\\ntype annotations using parametric container types via\\n[PEP-585](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/), introduced in Python 3.9.\\n\\n```python\\ndef generate_foo_scores(foo: set[str]) -> list[float]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.13-conditional-imports\"></a>\\n<a id=\"31913-conditional-imports\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"typing-conditional-imports\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.13 Conditional Imports \\n\\nUse conditional imports only in exceptional cases where the additional imports\\nneeded for type checking must be avoided at runtime. This pattern is\\ndiscouraged; alternatives such as refactoring the code to allow top-level\\nimports should be preferred.\\n\\nImports that are needed only for type annotations can be placed within an `if\\nTYPE_CHECKING:` block.\\n\\n-   Conditionally imported types need to be referenced as strings, to be forward\\n    compatible with Python 3.6 where the annotation expressions are actually\\n    evaluated.\\n-   Only entities that are used solely for typing should be defined here; this\\n    includes aliases. Otherwise it will be a runtime error, as the module will\\n    not be imported at runtime.\\n-   The block should be right after all the normal imports.\\n-   There should be no empty lines in the typing imports list.\\n-   Sort this list as if it were a regular imports list.\\n```python\\nimport typing\\nif typing.TYPE_CHECKING:\\n  import sketch\\ndef f(x: \"sketch.Sketch\"): ...\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"s3.19.14-circular-dependencies\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s3.19.14-circular-deps\"></a>\\n<a id=\"31914-circular-dependencies\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"typing-circular-deps\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.14 Circular Dependencies \\n\\nCircular dependencies that are caused by typing are code smells. Such code is a\\ngood candidate for refactoring. Although technically it is possible to keep\\ncircular dependencies, various build systems will not let you do so\\nbecause each module has to depend on the other.\\n\\nReplace modules that create circular dependency imports with `Any`. Set an\\n[alias](#typing-aliases) with a meaningful name, and use the real type name from\\nthis module (any attribute of `Any` is `Any`). Alias definitions should be\\nseparated from the last import by one line.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import Any\\n\\nsome_mod = Any  # some_mod.py imports this module.\\n...\\n\\ndef my_method(self, var: \"some_mod.SomeType\") -> None:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n<a id=\"typing-generics\"></a>\\n<a id=\"s3.19.15-generics\"></a>\\n<a id=\"31915-generics\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"generics\"></a>\\n#### 3.19.15 Generics \\n\\nWhen annotating, prefer to specify type parameters for generic types; otherwise,\\n[the generics\\' parameters will be assumed to be `Any`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#the-any-type).\\n\\n```python\\n# Yes:\\ndef get_names(employee_ids: Sequence[int]) -> Mapping[int, str]:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n# No:\\n# This is interpreted as get_names(employee_ids: Sequence[Any]) -> Mapping[Any, Any]\\ndef get_names(employee_ids: Sequence) -> Mapping:\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nIf the best type parameter for a generic is `Any`, make it explicit, but\\nremember that in many cases [`TypeVar`](#typing-type-var) might be more\\nappropriate:\\n\\n```python\\n# No:\\ndef get_names(employee_ids: Sequence[Any]) -> Mapping[Any, str]:\\n  \"\"\"Returns a mapping from employee ID to employee name for given IDs.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n# Yes:\\n_T = TypeVar(\\'_T\\')\\ndef get_names(employee_ids: Sequence[_T]) -> Mapping[_T, str]:\\n  \"\"\"Returns a mapping from employee ID to employee name for given IDs.\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n<a id=\"4-parting-words\"></a>\\n\\n<a id=\"consistency\"></a>\\n## 4 Parting Words \\n\\n*BE CONSISTENT*.\\n\\nIf you\\'re editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and\\ndetermine its style. If they use `_idx` suffixes in index variable names, you\\nshould too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make\\nyour comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.\\n\\nThe point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so\\npeople can concentrate on what you\\'re saying rather than on how you\\'re saying\\nit. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local\\nstyle is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different\\nfrom the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when\\nthey go to read it.\\n\\nHowever, there are limits to consistency. It applies more heavily locally and on\\nchoices unspecified by the global style. Consistency should not generally be\\nused as a justification to do things in an old style without considering the\\nbenefits of the new style, or the tendency of the codebase to converge on newer\\nstyles over time.\\n', metadata={'source': 'coding-standards/python-guidelines.md', 'file_path': 'coding-standards/python-guidelines.md', 'file_name': 'python-guidelines.md', 'file_type': '.md'}), Document(page_content='# Coding Guidelines - ReactJS\\n\\n\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n  1.

syntax\\n\\n```javascript\\n// bad\\n<Foo superLongParam=\"bar\"\\n     anotherSuperLongParam=\"baz\" />\\n\\n// good\\n<Foo\\n  superLongParam=\"bar\"\\n  anotherSuperLongParam=\"baz\"\\n/>\\n\\n//

/>\\n</Foo>\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Quotes\\n\\n- Always use double quotes (`\"`) for JSX attributes, but single quotes for all other JS.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// bad\\n<Foo bar=\\'bar\\' />\\n\\n// good\\n<Foo bar=\"bar\" />\\n\\n// bad\\n<Foo style={{ left: \"20px\" }} />\\n\\n// good\\n<Foo style={{ left: \\'20px\\' }} />\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Props\\n- Always use camelCase for prop names.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// bad\\n<Foo\\n    UserName=\"hello\"\\n    phone_number={12345678}\\n/>\\n\\n// good\\n<Foo\\n    userName=\"hello\"\\n    phoneNumber={12345678}\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n## Tags\\n- Always self-close tags that have no children.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// bad\\n<Foo className=\"stuff\"></Foo>\\n\\n// good\\n<Foo className=\"stuff\" />\\n```\\n\\n- If your component has multi-line properties, close its tag on a new line.\\n```javascript\\n// bad\\n<Foo\\n    bar=\"bar\"\\n    baz=\"baz\" />\\n\\n// good\\n<Foo\\n    bar=\"bar\"\\n    baz=\"baz\"\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Stateless function components\\nFor stateless components use the function syntax, introduced in React 0.14.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Using an ES2015 (ES6) arrow function:\\nvar Aquarium = (props) => {\\n    var fish = getFish(props.species);\\n    return <Tank>{fish}</Tank>;\\n};\\n\\n// Or with destructuring and an implicit return, simply:\\nvar Aquarium = ({species}) => (\\n    <Tank>\\n        {getFish(species)}\\n    </Tank>\\n);\\n\\n// Then use: <Aquarium species=\"rainbowfish\" />\\n```\\n\\n[Read More](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/09/10/react-v0.14-rc1.html#stateless-function-components)\\n\\n\\n\\n## PropTypes declarations\\n\\n- Setting propTypes declarations is mandatory\\n- Group them into required/none-required\\n- Alphabetically sort each group\\n- Separate them by a new line\\n\\n```javascript\\nstatic propTypes = {\\n    blank: React.PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\\n    block: React.PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\\n    size: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,\\n    to: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,\\n    disabled: React.PropTypes.bool,\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Prefixing none React methods\\nPrefix all none React methods within a component with an underscore.\\n\\n```javascript\\nclass Foo extends React.Component {\\n\\n    componentDidMount() {\\n        this._update();\\n    }\\n    \\n    _update() {\\n        // e.g. update position\\n    }\\n    \\n    render() {\\n        return (\\n            <div>foo</div>\\n        );\\n    }\\n}   \\n```\\n\\n## Prefixing component wide variables\\nIn the exception that you do not want to place a component wide variables on the state, you have to prefix it with an underscore.\\n\\n```javascript\\nclass Foo extends React.Component {\\n\\n    componentDidMount() {\\n        this._el = React.FindDOMNode(this.refs.foo);\\n    }\\n    \\n    render() {\\n        return (\\n            <div>foo</div>\\n        );\\n    }\\n}   \\n```\\n\\n\\n## Using handler methods\\n\\n- Name methods using `\\'_handle\\' + triggering event`, e.g. `_handleClick`\\n- Bind

Input Sources:\\n   1.  The app should support various input sources, including source code files, comments, and documentation tags within the code.\\n2. Language Support:\\n   1. The app must be able to parse and generate documentation for multiple programming languages.\\n3. Customization:\\n   1. Users should be able to customize the documentation output by manually editing the output.\\n4. Version Control Integration:\\n   1. Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes and update documentation accordingly.\\n5. Cross-Referencing:\\n   1. Provide automatic cross-referencing of code elements, allowing users to easily navigate between different parts of the documentation.\\n6. Documentation Preview:\\n   1. A real-time preview feature allowing users to see how the documentation will look before finalizing the generation.\\n\\n## Specifications\\n1. User Interface\\n   1. The initial implementation of our project will be a web app that, when provided with a github link, generates a confluence page describing what the app does based on classes/methods within.\\n2. Output Structure\\n   1. The confluence pages shall follow the same file structure as the source code and shall have a one to one mapping. Each page shall describe the source code at the functional level, ensuring that the source code is covered to an acceptable level.\\n3. Manual Editing\\n   1. When the confluence page is displayed to the uder, they will have the ability to manually update text within the documentation. The documentation will be able to be pushed to the source repository via a button click on the same page.  \\n4. Use of the LLM\\n   1. We will be implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend. RAG is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating a step to fetch new data based on user inputs, thus improving response accuracy. This process involves collecting new information from diverse sources (a code base in our use case) and converting it into a format the LLM can search\\n5. Automated Updating\\n   1. As far as updating goes, we will integrate Github Actions with our implementation such that a push to main in a hypothetical target repository would trigger a regeneration of the confluence page. This will ensure that the documentation remains up to date\\n', metadata={'source': 'documentation/requirements-specifications.md', 'file_path': 'documentation/requirements-specifications.md', 'file_name': 'requirements-specifications.md', 'file_type': '.md'}), Document(page_content='FLASK_APP=base.py\\nFLASK_ENV=development\\n', metadata={'source': 'flask-be/.flaskenv', 'file_path': 'flask-be/.flaskenv', 'file_name': '.flaskenv', 'file_type': ''}), Document(page_content='', metadata={'source': 'flask-be/__init__.py', 'file_path': 'flask-be/__init__.py', 'file_name': '__init__.py', 'file_type': '.py'}), Document(page_content='# backend/app.py\\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\\nimport requests\\nimport base64\\nimport json\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'\\n    DESCRIPTION -

Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**\\n\\nIf you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\\n\\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.\\n\\nYou don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.\\n\\n## Learn More\\n\\nYou can learn more in the [Create React App
