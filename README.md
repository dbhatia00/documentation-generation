# documentation-generation

## Overview

Documentation is difficult to write and keep up to date. Tools exist to generate rudimentary JavaDoc for Java programs, but the result isnâ€™t particularly helpful as it just gives parameter names and return types from the signature and no useful information. The goal of this project is to provide a more reasonable initial documentation source using LLMs and other tools.

For more detailed descriptions of our design, please visit [our documentation directory](https://github.com/dbhatia00/documentation-generation/tree/main/documentation).

This is how the user will interact with this application.

## Initial Implementation Goals

### Description

Our project is web app that, when provided a github link, generates a confluence page describing what the app does based on classes/methods within. The confluence pages shall follow the same file structure as the source code and shall have a one to one mapping. Each page shall describe the source code at the functional level, ensuring that the source code is covered to an acceptable level. The code works on **Java, Python, and Javascript** targets. 

# Run instructions

## Files to create

1. Download token_server.json and token_client.json from Slack
   1. Alternatively, generate a set of tokens from the Github Api and Confluence APIs
2. Put file token_server.json under path flask-be
   1. Should be in the following format - 
    ```javascript
    {
      "client_id": "{github API client ID}",
      "client_secret": "{github API client secret}",
      "confluence_client_id": "{confluence API client ID}",
      "confluence_client_secret": "{confluence API client secret}"
    }
    ```
3. Put file token_client.json under path react-fe/src
   1. Should be in the following format - 
    ```javascript
    {
      "client_id": "{github API client ID}",
      "confluence_client_id": "{confluence API client ID}"
    }
    ```

## Environment Variables to Make
1. Install [NGrok](https://ngrok.com/) to your machine
2. run `ngrok http 5000` and note the forwarding link (i.e. https://{...}.ngrok-free.app)
3. export the following variables
   1. `export WEBHOOK_SECRET={your NGrok secret}`
   2. `export WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_URL={the above URL}/webhook1`

## Backend

1. python3 -m venv env
2. source env/bin/activate
3. pip install flask
4. pip install python-dotenv
5. pip install requests
6. pip install pymongo
7. pip install pydantic
8. cd flask-be
9. export PYTHONPATH="{path to repo}/documentation-generation/flask-be:$PYTHONPATH"
10. flask run

The backend should now be running

## Frontend

1. cd react-fe
2. npm install
3. npm start

The frontend should now be running

# Automated Tests

There are a suite of tests to ensure that the frontend is rendered as expected, and the core backend functions work as expected. Refer to the below instructions for more.

## Frontend Tests

The tests can be run by doing the following -

1. cd react-fe
2. npm test

This will run the tests in react-fe/src/\_\_tests\_\_/App.test.js

## Backend Tests

The tests can be run by doing the following -

1. cd flask-be
2. python test_base.py

This will run the tests in flask-be/test_base.py
